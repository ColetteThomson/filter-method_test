// a common requirement when working with datasets  in JavaScript 
// is to find the objects in an array of objects that contain a 
// specific property. For example, what if you wanted to pluck just paul 
// out of the array of people above

const paul = people.filter(person => person.name === "Paul");
// can shorter 'person' to p.  
// Could add [0] to end to access object itself (i.e. just curlies no square brackets), so not as part of an array
const paul2 = people.filter(p => p.name === "Paul");
console.log(paul2);

// note: This method is extremely useful when working  with advanced JavaScript APIs because these APIs  
// will usually return large arrays containing  lots of data, and knowing how to filter it  
// down to only the data youâ€™re interested in is  crucial to getting the most out of those APIs.
